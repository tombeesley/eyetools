Description: Enables the automation of actions across the pipeline, including 
  initial steps of transforming binocular data and gap repair to event-based 
  processing such as fixations, saccades, and entry/duration in Areas of 
  Interest (AOIs). It also offers visualisation of eye movement and AOI 
  entries. These tools take relatively raw (trial, time, x, and y form) data 
  and can be used to return fixations, saccades, and AOI entries and time spent
  in AOIs. As the tools rely on this basic data format, the functions can work 
  with data from any eye tracking device. Implements fixation and saccade 
  detection using methods proposed by Salvucci and Goldberg (2000)
