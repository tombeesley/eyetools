# **eyetools**

## A set of tools for eye data processing, analysis and visualisation in R

**eyetools** is a package that provides a set of simple tools that will
facilitate common steps in the processing and analysis of eye data. It
is intended for use with data from psychological experiments. The idea
is to have a workflow which is aided by these functions, going from
processing of the raw data, to extraction of event related data (i.e.,
fixations, saccades), to summarising those data at the trial level
(e.g., time on areas of interest).

For an indepth guide to using eyetools, see the [Get Started
page](https://tombeesley.github.io/eyetools/articles/eyetools.html).

It is free to use under the GNU General Public Licence.

**To install use `install.packages("eyetools")`**

**Development version:**

The above CRAN version is considered fairly stable and will only be updated every few months. We work on new features in the development version. This version should be considered very experimental and may have bugs. You can install this using `devtools::install_github("tombeesley/eyetools@0.X.X")` where 0.X.X is the latest version. 

#### The current development version is: 0.9.0
The main changes are:

* removed the need to specify a name for the participant column. eyetools now expects the column 'pID' in all input data
* all 'plot_' functions now have a 'pID_values' parameter to enable selection of certain participant data to plot
* renamed 'trial_number' to 'trial_values' in all relevant functions, for consistency with the above change to pID_values
* fixed an issue where colour scale for fixations was dependent on showing fixation label
* cosmetic changes made to plotting of AOIs
