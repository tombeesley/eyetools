\usage{
AOI_time(
  data,
  data_type = NULL,
  AOIs,
  AOI_names = NULL,
  sample_rate = NULL,
  as_prop = FALSE,
  trial_time = NULL,
  participant_col = "participant_col"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe  of either fixation data (from fix_dispersion) or raw data}

\item{data_type}{Whether data is a fixation ("fix") or raw data ("raw")}

\item{AOIs}{A dataframe of areas of interest (AOIs), with one row per AOI (x, y, width_radius, height).}

\item{AOI_names}{An optional vector of AOI names to replace the default "AOI_1", "AOI_2", etc.}

\item{sample_rate}{Optional sample rate of the eye-tracker (Hz) for use with data. If not supplied, the sample rate will be estimated from the time column and the number of samples.}

\item{as_prop}{whether to return time in AOI as a proportion of the total time of trial}

\item{trial_time}{needed if as_prop is set to TRUE. a vector of the time taken in each trial. Equal to the length of x trials by y participants in the dataset}

\item{participant_col}{the variable that determines the participant identifier. If no column present, assumes a single participant}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the time on the passed AOIs for each trial. One column for each AOI separated by trial.
}
\description{
Analyses total time on defined AOI regions across trials. Works with fixation and raw data as the input (must use one or the other, not both).
}
\details{
AOI_time can take either single participant data or multiple participants where there is a variable for unique participant identification.
The function looks for an identifier named \code{participant_col} by default and will treat this as multiple-participant data as default,
if not it is handled as single participant data, or the participant_col needs to be specified
}
\examples{

\donttest{
data <- combine_eyes(HCL)
fix_d <- fixation_dispersion(data, participant_col = "pNum")

# fixation data
AOI_time(data = fix_d, data_type = "fix", AOIs = HCL_AOIs, participant_col = "pNum")

#raw data
AOI_time(data = data, data_type = "raw", AOIs = HCL_AOIs, participant_col = "pNum")

#as proportional data
AOI_time(data = fix_d, data_type = "fix", AOIs = HCL_AOIs, participant_col = "pNum",
         as_prop = TRUE, trial_time = HCL_behavioural$RT)
}
